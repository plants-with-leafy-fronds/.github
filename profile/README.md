Plants with leafy fronds include ferns, palms, cycads, and some flowering plants like mimosa and sumac. Fern fronds are the classic example, often large and divided, providing lush greenery in gardens and indoors[1][4][8].

These plants add texture and a tropical feel to spaces, with some like the New Zealand flax offering bold, sword-like foliage[2].
